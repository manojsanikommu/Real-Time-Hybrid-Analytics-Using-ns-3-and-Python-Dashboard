**Real-Time Hybrid Analytics Using ns-3 and Python Dashboard**

This project integrates ns-3 network simulation with a Python-based real-time analytics dashboard to provide an interactive environment for observing packet flow, socket connections, and communication behavior across a simulated network topology. The system is designed to help users visualize and understand live network events such as throughput, delay, packet transmission patterns, and socket-level interactions.

Key Features:
- ns-3 Simulation Environment
- Real-Time Python Dashboard
- Hybrid Analytics Architecture


Installation & Setup:
1. Install ns-3
2. Run the ns-3 Simulation
3. Start the Python Dashboard

Testing Instructions:
- Create socket-stream.cc and dashboard.py
- Build and run the simulation(ns-3)
- Run dashboard(python)
- See the live dashboard

Results Overview:
- Throughput Graph
- Live Energy Depletion Graph

Conclusion:
This hybrid analytics system successfully demonstrates how ns-3 simulations can be extended with real-time data visualization using Python, enabling interactive experimentation and improved understanding of network behavior.
